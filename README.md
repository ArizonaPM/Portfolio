# Portfolio
Hello my name is Austin Dwyer and this is a portfolio of my peronal projects I have made.

each unity folder has a exe folder. To run the game just download that folder and run the .exe file inside.

The 3DGame and ClickerGame were initialy made using some of the courses by Zenva Academy. However, after completing each course I spent a decent amount of time changing the games to have less bugs and to show off more of my skills.

I also have a Degree in Compter Science from VIU.
